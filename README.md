Hi!
My name is Pnini, student for computer science, and I'm very proud to introduce my first web API project.

This project represents a toy store.

To run my project you need Visual Studio 2022 and up. You can use code-first ability to create the DB.

The project is written with the .Net 7 environment, and the web API architecture. The client side is written in JS, HTML and CSS.
I added a Middleware to catch exceptions and handle them.
One more Middleware was created to save the rating- client's request's details in the DB.
It uses REST's architecture and kept its principles. (Sort, filter and etc.)
I was strict about using a strong password by using the zxcvbn library.
I worked layers which communicate with Dependency Injection to gain encapsulation and scalability.
The project uses the SQL database.
I was strict about using the Async and Await keywords along the whole way to add scalability.
I used ORM of EntityFramework.
I made my DB with DB-first ability.
The project has a documented swagger.
It uses the DTO layers for simplify the objects and prevents circulation.
I mapped the objects by using the AutoMapper library.
I was strict about logging the code, and used an email for error cases.
I used configuration files for changeable things.
I protected the sensitive data (like passwords).

I hope you'll enjoy my project and want to read your opinion on itðŸ˜Š
